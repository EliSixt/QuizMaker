# 👨‍🏫QuizMaker👩‍🏫

### The goal of this program is to act as flashcards to help show any weak areas in the material and to learn through self-test and repetition.
### In this flashcard quiz game the user creates their own questions and answer choices. 


It adds those questions and answers to a local file to store and read from.
The questions, along with the answers, get randomized and quizzed back to the user.
The user is then shown their results and correctly answered questions, with the option of reviewing through all or only the incorrect questions again.
